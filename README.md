# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

In this project I have created a Work Day Scheduler that will allow the user to enter information into the text boxes for that hour, which will be saved to the local storage.

## Legend

Grey text box = Past
Red text box = Present
Green text box = Future

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```
