# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

In this project I have created a Work Day Scheduler that will allow the user to enter information into the text boxes for that hour, which will be saved to the local storage.

The text boxes within the scheduler will periodically change color accordingly (refer to the Legend for more information).

## Legend

Grey text box = Past
Red text box = Present
Green text box = Future

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```
